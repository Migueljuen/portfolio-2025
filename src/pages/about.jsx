        I'm an aspiring frontend developer and UI designer, currently building
        my skills through hands-on projects and constant learning. I enjoy
        creating clean, functional, and visually engaging websites — focusing on
        simplicity, usability, and detail. <br />

          Outside of coding, I’m interested in gaming and fitness. When I’m not
          working on projects, you’ll usually find me exploring creative ideas,
          hitting the gym, or watching a good movie or series.
